Prompt: "What’s a simple way to detect a potential black hole attack based on ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' messages using scapy?"

Answer:

A **Black Hole Attack** occurs when malicious nodes drop packets without forwarding them to the destination, causing data loss. In network scenarios, if a node is dropping packets intentionally, one way to detect this is by monitoring **ICMP "Destination Unreachable"** messages, which are typically sent when a packet cannot reach its intended destination.

By sniffing for ICMP `Destination Unreachable` messages using `Scapy`, you can detect potential black hole attacks. This method involves watching for an abnormally high number of such ICMP messages, which could suggest that packets are being dropped intentionally.

### Steps:
1. **Sniff Network Traffic**: Use `Scapy` to monitor ICMP packets.
2. **Check for ICMP Type 3 (Destination Unreachable)**: Filter for ICMP messages with type `3`, which indicates "Destination Unreachable."
3. **Track Frequency of ICMP Messages**: If an IP sends an unusually high number of such messages, this could indicate a potential black hole attack.

### Code Example: Detecting Black Hole Attack Based on ICMP Messages

#### 1. **Install Scapy**:
Make sure you have `Scapy` installed:
```bash
pip install scapy
```

#### 2. **Python Code for ICMP "Destination Unreachable" Detection**:

```python
from scapy.all import sniff, IP, ICMP
from collections import defaultdict
import time

# Dictionary to track the number of ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' messages per IP
icmp_count = defaultdict(int)
# Dictionary to track the last time an ICMP message was received from an IP
last_seen = defaultdict(float)

# Time window (in seconds) and ICMP message threshold for detecting a black hole attack
TIME_WINDOW = 60  # 1 minute window
ICMP_THRESHOLD = 10  # More than 10 ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' messages in 1 minute

# Function to handle sniffed packets
def packet_handler(packet):
    if IP in packet and ICMP in packet:
        # Check if it's an ICMP Destination Unreachable message (Type 3)
        if packet[ICMP].type == 3:
            src_ip = packet[IP].src
            current_time = time.time()
            
            # Reset the count if the time window has passed
            if current_time - last_seen[src_ip] > TIME_WINDOW:
                icmp_count[src_ip] = 0
            
            # Update the last seen time for the IP
            last_seen[src_ip] = current_time
            
            # Increment the count of ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' messages for this IP
            icmp_count[src_ip] += 1
            
            # Check if the IP has exceeded the ICMP threshold
            if icmp_count[src_ip] > ICMP_THRESHOLD:
                print(f"[ALERT] Potential black hole attack detected! {icmp_count[src_ip]} 'Destination Unreachable' messages from {src_ip} in the last {TIME_WINDOW} seconds.")
            else:
                print(f"[INFO] {src_ip} sent {icmp_count[src_ip]} ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' messages.")
                

# Start sniffing on the specified network interface (e.g., "eth0")
sniff(iface="eth0", filter="icmp", prn=packet_handler, store=0)
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **Packet Sniffing**:
   - The `sniff()` function captures all **ICMP packets** on the specified network interface (e.g., `eth0`).
   - The filter `"icmp"` ensures that only ICMP packets are captured.

2. **Tracking ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' Messages**:
   - For each captured packet, the script checks if it’s an ICMP message and whether the **ICMP type** is `3`, which corresponds to a "Destination Unreachable" message.
   - The **source IP (`src_ip`)** is tracked, and the number of such ICMP messages from this IP is counted in `icmp_count[src_ip]`.

3. **Black Hole Attack Detection**:
   - If the number of ICMP messages from a particular IP exceeds the defined **threshold** (10 messages within 60 seconds in this case), the system flags it as a potential black hole attack.
   - The count resets if the time window (60 seconds) has passed without additional messages from the same IP.

### **Customization**:
- **Interface**: Modify the `iface="eth0"` to use the correct network interface, such as `wlan0` or your desired interface.
- **Threshold**: Adjust the `TIME_WINDOW` and `ICMP_THRESHOLD` values depending on your network traffic and tolerance for false positives.
- **Logging and Alerts**: You can extend the alerting mechanism to send emails, log suspicious activity, or trigger additional responses when a potential black hole attack is detected.

### **Example Output**:
If a source IP sends more than 10 ICMP "Destination Unreachable" messages in 60 seconds, you’ll get an alert:
```
[ALERT] Potential black hole attack detected! 12 'Destination Unreachable' messages from 192.168.1.101 in the last 60 seconds.
```
Otherwise, it will print informational messages:
```
[INFO] 192.168.1.101 sent 5 ICMP 'Destination Unreachable' messages.
```

### **Conclusion**:
By monitoring the frequency of ICMP "Destination Unreachable" messages using `Scapy`, you can detect potential black hole attacks. This method works by detecting an abnormal rate of such messages, which could indicate that packets are being intentionally dropped, especially when multiple unreachable messages are seen in a short period.
