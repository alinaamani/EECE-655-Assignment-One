Please access this link to open the Chat that contains all the outputs given by ChatGPT to my prompts.

Included all the prompts I used to ask the AI for help, including those that requested sample code or explanations about how to write specific parts to get an idea on how to write the code.

I asked brief writing prompt to help with the report because of the strict page limit. I didnâ€™t directly copy and paste the content; instead, I paraphrased some sentences and verified the information using the references included in the report.
